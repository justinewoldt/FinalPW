          <p class="wrap">Standing at 7 feet, 1 inch tall, Shaquille O'Neal quickly became known through his stardom in the NBA.
            Recognized for his dominant play, yet cheery attitude, O'Neal quickly became a worldwide phenomenon.  Shaquille was
            born in Newark, New Jersey on March 6th, 1972.  He graduated from Cole High School and went on to play college basketball
            at Louisiana State University.  Following his recent retirement from the NBA in 2011, O'Neal now works along side
            Charles Barkley and Ernie Johnson being an NBA analyst on "Inside the NBA".

            During Shaq's rookie season of NBA basketball, he went on to finish Top 10 in scoring,
            rebounding, blocks, and shooting percentage.   However, he began to build his name as a
            terrible free throw shooter.  O'Neal's signature move was to overpower his opponents with
            brute force.  Shaq is most known for his career with the Los Angeles Lakers, and the
            seven year, $120 million dollar contract that came with that.  Over that time, Shaq averaged
            23 points per game and 10 rebounds.  Shaq would continue to many different teams after the Lakers,
            before ultimately calling it quits in 2011.

            After retiring from the league, Shaquille gained more free time to spend on
            hobbies he enjoyed as a kid.  These hobbies brought out the true entertainer
            in Shaq.  Shaq shows off his variety of music to the public with opportunities to
            DJ in front of large crowds.  His list of performances include Lollapalooza, Tomorrowland
            , Boston's Big Night Live, and Shaq's Fun House.  When away from spinning the turn tables,
            Shaq has also engaged in a few acting roles.  These roles include <em>Blue Chips</em>, <em>Kazaam!</em>, <em>Steel</em>,
            and <em>Uncle Drew.</em>

            <em>Inside the NBA</em> premiered during the 1989-1990 NBA season.  Then, many hosts
            including Craig Sager, Hannah Storm, and Vince Cellini inconsistently ran the analyst
            panel.  It was not until the following season that Ernie Johnson Jr. joined the analyst
            panel as a full time host that the show began to gain following.  After retiring in 2011,
            Shaq also joined the panel where he was joined by Charles Barkley and Kenny Smith.  Today,
            they are one of the most watched NBA broadcasting shows.  There loyal audience enjoys a great
            deal of comedic content including bets, jokes, and quotes such as <em>"Gone Fishin'"</em>.
